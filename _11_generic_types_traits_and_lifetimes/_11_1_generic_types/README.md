# Generic Types

## Generic Types

Generic types are types that can be parameterized with other types. They are defined using angle brackets (`<>`) and can be used in function signatures, struct definitions, and enum definitions.

	```rust
	fn print<T>(value: T) {
		println!("The value is: {}", value);
	}

	struct Pair<T> {
		first: T,
		second: T,
	}

	enum List<T> {
		Empty,
		Cons(T, Box<List<T>>),
	}
	```

In the above example, `T` is a generic type that can be replaced with any type. This allows us to create functions, structs, and enums that can work with different types.

## Generic Functions

Generic functions are functions that can be parameterized with other types. They are defined using angle brackets (`<>`) and can be used in function signatures, struct definitions, and enum definitions.

	```rust
	fn print<T>(value: T) {
		println!("The value is: {}", value);
	}

	struct Pair<T> {
		first: T,
		second: T,
	}

	enum List<T> {
		Empty,
		Cons(T, Box<List<T>>),
	}
	```

In the above example, `T` is a generic type that can be replaced with any type. This allows us to create functions, structs, and enums that can work with different types.

## Generic Structs

Generic structs are structs that can be parameterized with other types. They are defined using angle brackets (`<>`) and can be used in function signatures, struct definitions, and enum definitions.

	```rust
	fn print<T>(value: T) {
		println!("The value is: {}", value);
	}

	struct Pair<T> {
		first: T,
		second: T,
	}

	enum List<T> {
		Empty,
		Cons(T, Box<List<T>>),
	}
	```

In the above example, `T` is a generic type that can be replaced with any type. This allows us to create functions, structs, and enums that can work with different types.

## Generic Enums

Generic enums are enums that can be parameterized with other types. They are defined using angle brackets (`<>`) and can be used in function signatures, struct definitions, and enum definitions.

	```rust
	fn print<T>(value: T) {
		println!("The value is: {}", value);
	}

	struct Pair<T> {
		first: T,
		second: T,
	}

	enum List<T> {
		Empty,
		Cons(T, Box<List<T>>),
	}
	```

In the above example, `T` is a generic type that can be replaced with any type. This allows us to create functions, structs, and enums that can work with different types.

## Generic Types in Functions

Generic types can be used in function signatures to create functions that can work with different types.

	```rust
	fn print<T>(value: T) {
		println!("The value is: {}", value);
	}

	fn main() {
		let x = 5;
		print(x);
	}
	```

In the above example, `T` is a generic type that can be replaced with any type. This allows us to create functions that can work with different types.

## Generic Types in Structs

Generic types can be used in struct definitions to create structs that can work with different types.

	```rust
	struct Pair<T> {
		first: T,
		second: T,
	}

	fn main() {
		let pair = Pair { first: 5, second: 10 };
		println!("The pair is: ({}, {})", pair.first, pair.second);
	}
	```

In the above example, `T` is a generic type that can be replaced with any type. This allows us to create structs that can work with different types.

## Generic Types in Enums

Generic types can be used in enum definitions to create enums that can work with different types.

	```rust
	enum List<T> {
		Empty,
		Cons(T, Box<List<T>>),
	}

	fn main() {
		let list = List::Cons(5, Box::new(List::Empty));
		println!("The list is: {:?}", list);
	}
	```

In the above example, `T` is a generic type that can be replaced with any type. This allows us to create enums that can work with different types.
