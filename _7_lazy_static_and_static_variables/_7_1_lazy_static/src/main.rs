/*
	Lazy Static
		Lazy static variables are a way to define a static variable that is only initialized when it is first accessed.
		Lazy static variables are useful when you want to define a static variable that is only initialized when it is first accessed.
		Lazy static variables are defined using the lazy_static! macro.

		The lazy_static! macro is used to define a lazy static variable.

		The lazy_static! macro takes a block of code as an argument and executes it when the lazy static variable is first accessed.
		This ensures that the code is only executed once and the result is stored in the lazy static variable.

		To use lazy static variables, you need to import the lazy_static crate and use the lazy_static! macro.
