/*
	Ownership, Borrowing and References
		Ownership
			Ownership is the concept of who owns a piece of memory.
			In Rust, every value has a variable that’s called its owner.
			There can only be one owner at a time.
			When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

			Ownership can be transferred to another variable using the let keyword.
			This is called moving ownership.

			Ownership Rules:
				1. Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.
				2. There can only be one owner at a time.
				3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
				4. Ownership can be transferred to another variable using the let keyword.
					- This is called moving ownership.
				5. References are a way to refer to a value without taking ownership of it.
					- References are immutable by default.
					- References can be mutable by using the mut keyword.
					- References can be dereferenced using the * operator.
					- References can be used to borrow values from a variable.
						- Borrowing allows you to use a value without taking ownership of it.
						- Borrowing is a way to share ownership of a value with another variable.
						- Borrowing can be done using references, slices, and arrays.
						- References can be either immutable or mutable.
							- Immutable references cannot be changed once they are created.
							- Mutable references can be changed after they are created.
		Borrowing
			Borrowing is a way to use a value without taking ownership of it.
			It allows you to use a value in multiple places without having to copy it.
			Borrowing is a way to share ownership of a value with another variable.
		References
			References are a way to refer to a value without taking ownership of it.
			They are immutable by default.
			References can be mutable by using the mut keyword.
			References can be dereferenced using the * operator.
			References can be used to borrow values from a variable.
