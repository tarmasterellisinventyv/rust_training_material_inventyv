/* Control Flow

	Control Flow are of two types:
		1. Conditional Control Flow: Control flow that is based on a condition.
		2. Unconditional Control Flow: Control flow that is not based on a condition.

	Conditional Control Flow
		1. if Statements
			- if Statements are used to conditionally execute code based on a condition.
			- if Statements have the following syntax:
				- if <condition> {
					- <code>
				- }
			- if Statements can be nested inside other if Statements.
			- if Statements can be used to conditionally execute code based on a condition.
		2. else Statements
			- else Statements are used to conditionally execute code based on a condition.
			- else Statements have the following syntax:
				- if <condition> {
					- <code>
				- } else {
					- <code>
				}
			- else Statements can be nested inside other else Statements.
			- else Statements can be used to conditionally execute code based on a condition.
		3. else if Statements
			- else if Statements are used to conditionally execute code based on a condition.
			- else if Statements have the following syntax:
				- if <condition> {
					- <code>
				- } else if <condition> {
					- <code>
				}
			- else if Statements can be nested inside other else if Statements.
			- else if Statements can be used to conditionally execute code based on a condition.
		4. match Statements
			- match Statements are used to conditionally execute code based on a value.
			- match Statements have the following syntax:
				- match <value> {
					- <pattern> => <code>,
					- <pattern> => <code>,
					- ...
				}
			- match Statements can be nested inside other match Statements.
			- match Statements can be used to conditionally execute code based on a value.

	Unconditional Control Flow
		1. for Loops
			- for Loops are used to iterate over a range of values.
			- for Loops have the following syntax:
				- for <pattern> in <range> {
					- <code>
				}
			- for Loops can be nested inside other for Loops.
			- for Loops can be used to iterate over a range of values.
		2. while Loops
			- while Loops are used to iterate as long as a condition is true.
			- while Loops have the following syntax:
				- while <condition> {
					- <code>
				}
			- while Loops can be nested inside other while Loops.
			- while Loops can be used to iterate as long as a condition is true.
		3. Loop Control Statements
			- Loop Control Statements are used to control the flow of a loop.
			- Loop Control Statements have the following syntax:
				- break;
				- continue;
			- Loop Control Statements can be used to control the flow of a loop.
			- break; is used to exit a loop prematurely.
			- continue; is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration.
